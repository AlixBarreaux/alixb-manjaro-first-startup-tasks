DESCRIPTION:

This script installs all the packages (softwares and programs)
you want automatically. A basic list is here for you to use already
but you can modify as you wish.




HOW TO USE:

This introduction paragraph is here for you to customize the script.
If you don't want to do so, you can just run it and say no to the
packages you don't want to install. If you want to do so, read this:

<- Hashatgs "#" are disablind the code in order to write
anything you want in here. If you want to disable a line
of code, put it at the left of the line you want to disable.
You must do it for EACH SINGLE line you want to disable.
Alternatively, you can just remove the line of code.

If you just want to remove one or several packages you
can just delete the names with the comma ","
Example: We don't want leaf and nemo to be installed:
sudo pacman -S nemo, gparted, firefox, leaf, libreoffice
Becomes now:
sudo pacman -S gparted, firefox, libreoffice
Obviously there must be no space at the end and the beginning
of the line and no hastag "#" for it to be run.
Each package name must be separated by a comma ","
Don't put a comma at the end of the line of code
