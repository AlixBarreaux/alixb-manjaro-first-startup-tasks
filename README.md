# Description:

A bash script I used with Linux Manjaro to install my own packages, appimages, softwares, etc... 
when installing Linux Manjaro (DE: Cinnamon) automatically.
There are some sections in the script to help picking certain packages.


## Intructions:

Run the script: `bash first_startup_installer_manjaro.sh`
